EatWhat is a website that provides online food ordering services for customers to order mixed rice. EatWhat website performs three basic functions - order food online, check order status and submit feedback. Fundamentally, customers can browse the menu and select from a variety of choices ranging from main, vegetables, meat, seafood to drinks. Customers may select their food and proceed to the checkout session. In the checkout session, customers can choose from dine-in, self-pickup and delivery. They will be asked to provide required information, such as name, contact and address. Following is the payment section, where the customers are expected to pay via a QR code. A successful payment would lead to the completion of order, in the meantime, a confirmation email will be sent to the provided email address. Once the order is submitted, customers may check the order status in the order status section by entering their email address. In addition to ordering services, there is a feedback section where customers may contact EatWhat via web form or email.
